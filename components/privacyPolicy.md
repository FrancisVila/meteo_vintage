## Meteo Vintage : Privacy policy

Welcome to the Meteo Vintage app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Francis Vila. The app is  available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app are as follows:

<br/>

*  `android.permission.VIBRATE` : Required to vibrate the device when alarm is ringing. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user.            

* `android.permission.INTERNET` : Allows the app to connect to the internet to gather weather information.
                  
*  `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: The only sensitive permissions that the app requests, and can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. This is required only if you want to store the list of places to which the user has navigated to read the weather.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Francis Vila.
